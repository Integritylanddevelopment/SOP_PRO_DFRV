# Workflow Pro - Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Setting Up for a New Company

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Fork this Replit project to your account
2. Rename the fork to your company name (e.g., "pine-valley-rv-workflow")

### Step 2: Configure Company Settings
Edit `config/company-config.json`:

```json
{
  "company": {
    "name": "Pine Valley RV Resort",
    "slug": "pine-valley-rv",
    "description": "Family-friendly RV resort with lake access",
    "website": "https://pinevalleyrv.com",
    "industry": "Hospitality - RV Resort",
    "logo": "/assets/pine-valley-logo.png"
  },
  "branding": {
    "primary": "hsl(120, 40%, 30%)",  // Forest Green
    "secondary": "hsl(35, 60%, 50%)",  // Warm Orange  
    "accent": "hsl(200, 20%, 85%)"     // Light Blue
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update Branding Colors
Update `client/src/index.css` root variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary: hsl(120, 40%, 30%);     /* Your primary brand color */
  --secondary: hsl(35, 60%, 50%);    /* Your secondary color */
  --accent: hsl(200, 20%, 85%);      /* Your accent color */
}
```

### Step 4: Customize Content

#### Handbook Content
Edit handbook sections in your seed data:
- Welcome message with your company culture

Customize SOPs for your industry:
- **RV Resort**: Check-in/out, maintenance, guest services

### Step 5: Add Your Logo
1. Upload your company logo to `client/src/assets/`
2. Update the logo path in your company config
3. Ensure logo is optimized for web (PNG/SVG recommended)

```bash
npm run db:push    # Create database tables
npm run seed       # Add your company data
```

```
